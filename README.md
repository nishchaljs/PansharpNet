# PansharpNet
A novel CNN is proposed for pansharpening to obtain high resolution multispectral data from panchromatic and multispectral images. It
utilises the complementary resolutions and bands of both
panchromatic and multispectral images to learn and predict
results. Since the satellite images have high spatial resolution,
they are broken down into smaller chunks and built back once
the desired features are extracted and fused. The pansharpened
images can then be used to carry out the segmentation tasks
